          <h1>From Humble Beginnings</h1>
          <p>
            While riding through the forests of Burma, our founder, Mr. M.
            Manal, saw a villager pacify a restless elephant by feeding it the
            root of the plant Rauwolfia serpentina. Fascinated by the plant's
            effect on the elephant, he returned home to India to seek scientific
            evidence for why this particular plant would have such a beneficial,
            calming effect. Young Manal's mother gave him her bangles to sell so
            he could pursue his work, and Himalaya was born. Once he fully
            understood the science behind this special botanical, Mr. Manal
            bought a hand-operated, tablet-compressing machine and began his
            work. At night, his shoulders would ache from producing a few
            hundred tablets, one small tablet at a time. But his hard work paid
            off. This remarkable plant would later become Serpina, the world’s
            first anti-hypertensive drug in 1934. We remain in awe of the man
            who began our company, and the grandfather of our current CEO,
            Nabeel Manal. Himalaya’s legacy has always been one of researching
            nature and using the tools of modern science to develop and produce
            Ayurveda-based, pharmaceutical-grade herbal medicine products. And
            today, that legacy continues. Mr. Manal had a vision of helping
            people be well. Today, Himalaya Herbal Healthcare has turned a
            time-honored herbal tradition into a complete range of contemporary,
            proprietary formulas and single herbs dedicated to making the world
            well one person at a time.
